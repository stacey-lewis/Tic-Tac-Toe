--How it was built--
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to build this game.

--How to play / Features--

On entry you can select a single or multi-player game - player 1 is a bug icon, and player 2 is a dinosaur icon.

You will then go to another screen which will ask you to fill in the name of each player.

Take in turns playing, until the game is drawn or won. The game will track wins and loses in the green circle on the respective player sides. To continue to play and track scores between games, select the 'Play again' button. To reset (select single vs multi-player and reset scoring) you can click the reset button and it will take you back to the entry screen.



--Future feature / Wishlist--

- Ability to choose player token
- Different animated tokens per square
- Support network multiplayer
- 'Easy' level AI opponent
